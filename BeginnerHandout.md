# Welcome
Welcome to programming in Python on the Raspberry Pi!  We put together this tutorial to walk you through the journey of learning the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org) using the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.rasberrypi.org).

Learning an entire programming language is really tough, but don't worry, we have folks available to help you!  We also don't expect you to learn all the aspects of programming right here, right now.  We expect you will have questions and will run into problems as you work through these exercises.  That's okay!  Ask questions, work with other students and experts, and make your own learning journey.
